                  <strong>
                      My website has been created using a web framework called Django. Django is an open source high-level python script that takes care of the base website, allowing the main programmers focus to lie on writing the app.

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    In a Django driven website, the app waits for a HTTP request from the client before showing the content. The URL function (urls.py) processes the requests sent from the client and maps them to the appropriate ‘View’,  webpage, by searching the string patterns created by the user. A URL mapper (urlpatterns) is responsible for creating paths to other areas in the website. In my website, I have created other HTML documents to expand on the website created in hand.

                    &nbsp;
                    Using the data given by the URL function, views.py is the main body of the website, linking the HTTP responses to templates and models. All of these functions use render() which creates a HTTP request that is relayed back to the client. It links the HTML file back to the URL back to the client

                    Models provides the function to read and write data, formatting them to a data base. Personally for my portfolio website, I didn’t add anything into this python file; as I had nothing to put into the database. 
                    <br>After being requested from views, the template file contains HTML (hypertext mark-up language); this is what the user controls in the website. 
                </div>
                <div class = "modal-title">
                    <h3><strong>HTML file</strong></h3>
                    &nbsp;
                </div>
                <div class="modal-secondarycontent">
                    My home page is contained in the file home.html, which is a HTML5 file. Before creating this website I felt quite confident in HTML programming so I had high ambitions. Following off templates, I knew how I wanted the website to look. 
                    <br>
                    I used a modular based approach for the website, where each scroll down had its own Div class, this made it easier to edit the code; and add pre-sets in.

                    <br>
                    For my blog page I wanted to add modals, a graphical interface that goes over the applications main window; I found this the most challenging part of creating this website. First off I created a simple modal, using the built in HTML modal class; this worked well for just one modal however, on my home screen I needed multiple amounts of modals to be shown. Instead of copying the code again and changing the code for each of the ‘learn more’ buttons, I went back to the drawing board. I used a method called .getElementsByClassName, in Javascript, which searches the whole document for the phrase indented in the brackets; and gives each of the functions a numerical value. 
                </div>
                <div class="modal-code">

                    <span style="color:rgb(98, 96, 235);">var</span> <span style="color:rgb(131, 210, 236)">slidesJS</span> = <span style="color:rgb(131, 210, 236)">document</span><span style="color:rgb(202, 193, 107);">.getElementsByClassName</span>(<span style="color:orange;">"blog-preview"</span>);
                </div>
                <div class="modal-secondarycontent">
                    The selection of modals is processed through the slideIndex number, which looks at which modal expansion is pressed. This is an example of the code used with the ‘onclick’ button function. The modal gets opened with the 2nd modal content.
                </div>
                <div class="modal-code">
                    <span style="color:rgb(202, 193, 107);">openModal</span><span style="color:orange;">()</span>;<span style="color:rgb(202, 193, 107);">currentSlide</span><span style="color:orange;">(</span>2<span style="color:orange;">)</span>
                </div>
                <div class="modal-secondarycontent">
                    Another difficulty faced was the ‘overflow’ function, which disables the scroll feature when the modal is open. Typically modals are small overlays that don’t cover the whole screen however, my modals contained a whole blog that required scrolling. Therefore, with scrolling disabled I could neither scroll on the main page or the overlay. After many hours spent on stack overflow, I found that I needed to use a different display style with the modal but also had to change the body’s documentation to allow this change in users actions. 
                    <br>My website also contains a downloadable CV and a contact me page, that sends an email to my personal email address.

                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and controls the layout of the web page. They are used for nearly every design element of making a website. For my website I showed all three ways to use CSS, Inline, Internal and External. Inline, uses ‘style’ on the same line as the words

                <div class="modal-secondarycontent">
                    Internal CSS was used in my HTML for button styling and modal styling, this could’ve been added to an external CSS file however, I decided to put it in my main file for ease of use when creating the modals.

                    Javascript is added into pages to add interactivity for the user on the page.

This was relatively easy to implement and I had to adjust some of the values to toggle them into position but overall worked well.

                  It’s equally as scary thinking I’ll be a second year student next year, where the work ramps up exponentially. 
                  Freshers was amazing. I met loads of new people and spent the whole time socialising with everyone. This was the perfect opportunity to join new societies as well, so I joined the go-karting team, the ski-team and also one of the university’s campus football teams. A lot of sport! 
                  This was also the first time where I had lived away from home, so the challenge of adulthood really stepped in quickly.

                <div class="modal-secondarycontent">
                  Social side aside, I’ve loved the topics I had this year in Computer science. We started the term learning Java script, and although this was a challenge for me at the start, as I had not done computing A-level, after a few weeks I got to grip of it and excelled through the tasks. I learnt a lot during this module, such as the fundamental lesson that planning before starting a project is always the way to go. Collaboration really helped me as well, as in some tasks we got given partially competed code, where we had to continue the coding method to expand this pre-made program. 
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  Alongside the Java aspect of the course, we also had Mathematics tuition. This module focused on the mathematics behind Computer Science, covering a range of topics from regular languages to the complexity of NP and P problems. I had to think quite hard in this module, reading around the course to get a full grasp about the power of these mathematic equations.  
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  As a Bachelor of Science degree apprenticeship student with Vodafone, I was required to study Finance and Business Management as part of my widening horizons modules. Their goal was to give me insight into how organisations are structured; from how they work their balance sheet to understanding EBITDA formulas . It really helped having past experience in Economics for this module, as I could implement everything I learnt for a level into my end of year dissertation.

                <div class="modal-secondarycontent">
                    The second term consisted of Robotics, Artificial intelligence and Logic & Computation. I loved Robotics because we could see our code running on a machine, instead of just a computer. Hardware vs Software was a problem for the robots as we would code a piece of software that would complete every task when tested in a software sandbox but fail in a real-life. This involved a lot of trial and error but I thoroughly enjoyed this process.
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  I found Artificial Intelligence the hardest topic in Computer Science, as I was introduced to many alien terms. It took time to fully understand the ideas around machine learning and all of the equations behind it.
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  
                  Logic and Computation took a lot of time to fully understand but as the name suggests, when fully understood, was quite logical! The complexity of the topics increased every week and it was essential that I understood the basic ideas in order to extend my thinking.

                    I found the final expedition to be the hardest element. We decided that Dartmoor gave us the best potential to meet all the objectives set but the weather made the five day expedition the largest challenge. The mix of torrential rainfall followed by a seemingly tropical heatwave led this being a very large challenge but the sense of accomplishment on the final day was fantastic.
                    &nbsp;
                    <br>My volunteering was completed through my leadership of Reddam House CCF contingent, where I held the position of Colour Sergeant, with responsibility for organising the training and supervision of the younger and lower rank cadets.  For my physical element I developed my love of football, tennis and cross country. Initially, I hoped that my A level Art would qualify for the skills section, but was guided to choose another area, so focussed on cookery.
                    &nbsp;
                    <br>This cooking skill was put to good use on Dartmoor and also in my first year in self-catering accommodation; I’ve definitely become quite inventive about making meals out of limited ingredients!
